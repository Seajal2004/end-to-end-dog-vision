# end-to-end-dog-vision
Used machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.
We're going to go through the following TensorFlow/Deep Learning workflow:

Get data ready (download from Kaggle, store, import).
Prepare the data (preprocessing, the 3 sets, X & y).
Choose and fit/train a model (TensorFlow Hub, tf.keras.applications, TensorBoard, EarlyStopping).
Evaluating a model (making predictions, comparing them with the ground truth labels).
Improve the model through experimentation (start with 1000 images, make sure it works, increase the number of images).
Save, sharing and reloading your model (once you're happy with the results).
